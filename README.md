# Steve Syfuhs

I'm a dev on the Azure Active Directory team at Microsoft building authentication services and stuff. I've most recently been focusing on filling in platform authentication gaps for hybrid environments.

Before that I spent a decade mostly doing the same thing but for other teams or companies.

If you're interested in that sort of history there's LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/syfuhs/

I have some things written down at https://syfuhs.net/.
